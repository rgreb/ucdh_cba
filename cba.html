<p><strong>Arbitration Process:</strong></p>

should be identified at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the
hearing.</p></li>
<li><p>When practicable, the University shall inform the Union in
writing of its intent to assert the issue of arbitrability prior to
selection of the arbitrator. The issue(s) of arbitrability shall be
resolved in a hearing prior to and separate from the hearing (if any)
about the substantive facts and/or allegations in dispute, except as
provided in §C.3., below. In the event an arbitrator, as a result of the

raises for the first-time issue(s) of arbitrability, a single hearing on
the issue of arbitrability and the substantive facts will be held,
unless the parties agree otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the
grievance to be not arbitrable, the substantive facts of the case need
not be heard, and the grievance shall be denied. If the arbitrator finds
in favor or arbitrability, the hearing shall proceed to the substantive
issue(s) raised.</p></li>

facts, the arbitrator’s conclusion(s) as to the violation of the

<li>In the event that the University raises the issue of arbitrability,
the parties agree that the question of arbitrability shall be addressed
prior to the hearing on the merits (if any) by different arbitrators
unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. All arbitrator and
stenographer fees associated with a hearing on arbitrability shall be

<p><strong>B. ROTATION(S) TO AFFILIATED INSTITUTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Consistent with ACGME program requirements, the University affirms
its obligation to ensure that Residents have access to food while on
duty, including when on rotation at an affiliated institution. Because
affiliated institutions are not owned or operated by the University, the
University cannot ensure that Residents are provided free food while on
rotation.</p>
<p>Programs that provide or elect to provide additional benefits: Some
programs, as of the effective date of this contract, provide meal
allowances to Residents and Fellows that exceed what is provided for by

specific meal allowances. Prior to making any reduction to said meal
allowances, the University shall provide notice to the union prior to
implementation; and upon written request by the union, the University
shall meet and discuss the change.</p>
<h2 id="article-21-moonlighting">ARTICLE 21 MOONLIGHTING</h2>
<p>Each training program must have a moonlighting policy, which
specifies whether or not Residents in that program are allowed to
moonlight. Individual programs may prohibit moonlighting by residents in
their program, as per ACGME requirements.</p>
<p>In training programs that allow moonlighting, the program’s policy
and procedures must comply with the UC Davis Health Moonlighting Policy
and procedures and may be more restrictive. A Resident must be in good
standing with the program and must obtain written permission from their
program director to moonlight internally and/or externally.</p>
<p>Each program policy must contain a method for writing pre-approval,
monitoring (which must include the method for tracking hours), and
periodic review. Residents must not be required to engage in
moonlighting (internal or external), and this must be clearly stated in
the policy. Each program must demonstrate ongoing compliance with

of parental leave with pay each academic year to a parent to allow them
to bond with a newborn child or child recently placed via adoption,
provided the leave takes place within one year of the birth of the child
or placement of the child with the Resident or Fellow. The intent is
that the eight (8) workweeks of parental leave is the maximum amount of
leave per pregnancy/adoption event. For example, a Resident having twins
would not receive twelve (12) workweeks. A Resident would also not
receive another six (6) workweeks of parental leave if the leave is used
in two different academic years. By accepting this parental leave
benefit, the union declines to participate in the systemwide benefit
offering eight weeks of leave at 70% of wages.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> If the Resident or Fellow is eligible for leave
under the Family and Medical Leave Act and/or the California Family
Rights Act, parental leave can extend to up to twelve (12) workweeks. If
the Resident or Fellow wishes to be paid for workdays beyond the paid
entitlement in paragraph 1 during parental leave, the Resident or Fellow
may use accumulated sick and/or vacation time for such pay.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Training program leadership will work with
Residents/Fellows who, due to parental leave, need to make up time
required for graduation and/or board certification with the goal of
minimizing extension of training.</p>
