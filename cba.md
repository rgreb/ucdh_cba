with the UC Davis Health Moonlighting Policy and procedures and may be more restrictive. A
Resident must be in good standing with the program and must obtain written permission from
their program director to moonlight internally and/or externally.

include the method for tracking hours), and periodic review. Residents must not be required to
engage in moonlighting (internal or external), and this must be clearly stated in the policy. Each

workweeks of parental leave is the maximum amount of leave per pregnancy/adoption
event. For example, a Resident having twins would not receive twelve (12) workweeks. A
Resident would also not receive another six (6) workweeks of parental leave if the leave is

declines to participate in the systemwide benefit offering eight weeks of leave at 70% of
wages.

and/or the California Family Rights Act, parental leave can extend to up to twelve (12)

   authorized by Residents. The University agrees to deduct the amounts certified by CIR/SEIU

   amount shall be a percentage of defined bargaining unit earnings set by the Union consistent
   with its dues structure.
2. Certification of new individual authorizations for union membership dues deduction must
   be provided to the University by way of CIR/SEIU providing a completed Excel spreadsheet.
   The appropriate deduction will commence as soon thereafter as possible, but in no case later
   than first of the month following sixty (60) calendar days after the certification of
   authorization for such deduction is provided to the University by CIR/SEIU.
3. The authorization for dues deduction shall remain in full force and effect during the full term

### C. PROGRAMMING & ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES & REMITTANCE LISTS RELATED TO UNION

### SECURITY

1. The University agrees to electronically transfer funds to CIR/SEIU banking account for all
   union payroll deduction remittance monies in which an administrative fee of $10 will be
   applied against the remittance monies. The union shall be responsible for any reasonable
   initial programming and monthly processing costs associated with the implementation and
   maintenance of the union payroll deductions. Monthly processing costs are .07 cents per
   employee to cover calculation and reporting. Those costs are applied against the remittance
   monies. The University will provide the union with a programming estimate and the union
   will issue payment when ratification notice is issued to the University at which time the
   University will begin programming for the union payroll deductions and remittance monies
   reporting. In the event the union fails to pay the University in accordance with the foregoing,
   the University may withhold the appropriate amount from the monthly dues paid to the
   union provided for in this paragraph.
2. On a monthly basis, the University will provide a remittance report listing of Residents by
   name, employee identification number, in-unit earnings, title code, and amount of union
   payroll deductions. The union shall be responsible for any reasonable initial and ongoing
   programming and processing costs associated with providing this list.
3. The University shall not be responsible for those portions of payroll deductions where the
   Resident’s earnings are insufficient to cover the union payroll deductions in any pay period.

**D. UNION CHANGES IN DEDUCTION AMOUNTS**

Any changes in the rate to be deducted for Resident dues shall be certified to the University by
the union, in writing, at least forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the effective date of the dues
amount change and mailed to the University’s designated office. The union may change the
dues percentage rate or cap once in a twelve (12) month period at no cost. If the union decides
to change the dues percentage or due cap more than once in as 12 - month period, the union will
need to pay for the system programming.

**E. POLITICAL ACTION CONTRIBUTION (PAC) UNION PAYROLL DEDUCTION**

The University agrees to honor the union political action contribution payroll deduction
authorization for Residents who are union members. The union will provide the University
with a list via an Excel (*.xls) completed spreadsheet. (Attached as Appendix X.) The Resident
must be an active dues paying member for this deduction to occur. The union shall be
responsible for any reasonable initial and ongoing costs associated with setting up and
maintaining this additional union payroll deduction. PAC deductions shall be remitted to the
union on a monthly basis, less any processing charges. PAC deductions are to be a flat dollar
amount and to be reoccurring each month. Implementation of a PAC deduction will be effective
on the first of the month following sixty (60) days' notice of receipt of the completed Excel
spreadsheet reflecting the Resident’s authorization to add or stop the reoccurring deduction.

### F. CORRECTIONS OF ERRORS

1. If the University fails to make authorized deductions of union dues and/or PAC or fails to remit
   to CIR/SEIU such authorized deductions or any portion thereof, or erroneously withholds
   deductions or any part thereof, the University shall correct the errors. The University shall
   refund to CIR/SEIU any deductions it has erroneously failed to remit.
2. From the time CIR/SEIU notifies the University in writing of any such errors, or if the
   University becomes aware of such errors, the University shall have forty-five (45) calendar
   days to make the corrections to be effective no later than the next payroll period.
3. The University shall not deduct more than two times the normal dues deduction in any given
   pay period, until the errors have been fully corrected.
4. It is expressly understood and agreed that CIR/SEIU shall refund to the employee any
   deductions erroneously withheld from the employee’s wages by the University and paid to
   CIR/SEIU.

**G. INDEMNIFICATION**

The union shall indemnify the University for any claims made by Residents for deductions made
by the University in reliance on the union's certification or on the union's representation as to
whether deductions for the union were properly canceled or changed. The University shall
promptly provide notice to the union of any claim, demand, suit, or other action for which it is
seeking indemnification.

## ARTICLE 37 VACATION

Vacation leave with compensation shall be four (4) seven-day workweeks per academic year.
Vacation time does not accrue from year to year and must be scheduled and taken in the same
academic year the vacation is earned. The total amount of vacation leaves due a Resident will
be credited to the Resident at the beginning of the appointment. As the Resident uses vacation
leave, the leave balance will decrease accordingly. If a Resident separates from the University
before the scheduled end of the appointment term, the Resident's leave balance will be
adjusted to reflect only that amount of vacation leave which would be proportionate to the
duration of the Resident's actual appointment. Any vacation leaves not used by the end of the
academic year, or at the end of the Resident’s appointment, will be cashed out.
Vacation leave shall be scheduled by the program pursuant to the program’s written policies
which will be in compliance with each program’s ACGME Program Requirements and/or
certifying board requirements. In scheduling vacation, programs should take into account any
requests for specific dates or blocks of time by individual Residents, but all parties understand
that it may not always be possible to accommodate a Resident’s requests.
Upon graduation or separation from a program, any unused vacation time will not carry over to
any other University position but will be cashed out.

and including termination of employment.

**D.** The Union shall not in any way authorize, assist, encourage, participate in, sanction, ratify,
condone, or lend support to any activities in violation of this article. In the event there is a
threatened or actual strike, work stoppage, sickout, slowdown, boycotting, interruption of
work, or any other activity in violation of this Agreement, the Union shall immediately give
